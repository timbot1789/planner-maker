# A Simple Solid Calendar

This project was created for the [March 2024 Solid Hackathon](https://solidhack.org/). The goal is to produce an easy-to-use calendar application that produces interoperable data and that can be embedded into other solid apps.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Developing

We are using Vite as our primary build tool. We also have a solid server to aid development.

We recommend developing like this:

In one terminal, run vite

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal, run the solid server

```bash
npm run pod
```

This will get you set up with everything you need to test the app, and will automatically refresh after any changes.

However, you could use your own Solid Pod on any Solid Provider to send and receive calendar. Here are some of the popular ones to get started:

- [Community Solid Server](https://solidweb.me)
- [Node Solid Server](https://solidweb.org)
- [Solid Community](https://solidcommunity.net)
- [Inrupt Pod Spaces](https://start.inrupt.com/profile)

The calendar events will be saved to "calendar-events" folder in your main container, this can be configured to any folder destination of your choosing.

# Event

The ShEx shape used in this Solid App for the events in the calendar is defined in [event.shex](./src/.shapes/event.shex). They are of [Event](https://schema.org/Event) type.

The following properties are associated with this [Event](https://schema.org/Event):

- organizer ([Person](https://schema.org/Person))
- name ([String](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string))
- startDate ([dateTime](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime))
- endDate ([dateTime](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime))
- attendees ([Person](https://schema.org/Person/))
- location ([Place](https://schema.org/Place/))
- about ([Thing](https://schema.org/Thing/))

## Linting

Linting of TypeScript files is provided by [ESLint](eslint.org) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint). In addition, [lit-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-analyzer) is used to type-check and lint lit-html templates with the same engine and rules as lit-plugin.

The rules are mostly the recommended rules from each project, but some have been turned off to make LitElement usage easier. The recommended rules are pretty strict, so you may want to relax them by editing `.eslintrc.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

To lint the project run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for code formatting. It has been pre-configured according to the Lit's style. You can change this in `.prettierrc.json`.

You can run prettier with

```bash
npm run format
```

Prettier has not been configured to run when committing files, but this can be added with Husky and `pretty-quick`. See the [prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) site for instructions.
